I decided to move away from WordPress for my personal blog and it wasn't an easy decision due to the fact that I have been using WordPress for a decade now as a WordPress Theme and Plugin developer.

Even if this blog is not a WordPress site, I will be continue using WordPress on my other site since I will be making themes for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and [ClasspicPress](https://classpicpress.net).

## What makes this site different
I am running a custom PHP platform built by [Justin Tadlock](http://justintadlock) and now I'm currently using it and modify I see fit.
